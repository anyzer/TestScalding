Data Locality: processing data locally whenever possible. Core to Hadoop, intentionally attempts to minimize the amount of data transferred across the network.
Shared Nothing: refers to tasks  that can be executed independently on a distributed processing platform such as Hadoop that do not require synchronization or sharing of state wth one another
Core Components of Hadoop: HDFS, YARN

HDFS
    '''
    Hadoop applies Master-Slave Cluster Architecture (the master and slave process are predefined, static role for the lifetime)

    File, Blocks, and Metadata

    NameNode: is a madatory process necessary for HDFS to operate.
        * HDFS Master Node process which manage the filesystem
        * http://127.0.0.1:50070/dfshealth.html#tab-overview  (local Hadoop UI)
        * Tip: Data Does Not Go Through the NameNode
             It is a common misconception that data goes into HDFS via the
             NameNode. This is not the case as it would create a bottleneck.
             Instead, the client interacts with the NameNode to get directives on
             which cluster node(s) to communicate with to get or put blocks that
             pertain to the file the client is trying to read or write.

    SecondaryNameNode/Standby NameNode: are optional processes that expedite filesystem recovery or provide a failover process in the event of a NameNode failure.

    DataNode: DetaNode process is a HDFS slave node daemon that runs on one or more nodes of the HDFS clusters.
        * The DataNodes are the nodes of the cluster on which HDFS blocks are stored and managed
        * Caution: DataNodes Are Not Aware of HDFS Files and Directories
            DataNodes store and manage physical HDFS blocks only, without
            having any knowledge of how these blocks are related to files and
            directories in the HDFS filesystem. This relationship is held only in
            the NameNodeâ€™s metadata.
    '''

YARN
    '''
    YARN governs the processing of data in Hadoop, which typically is data sourced from and written to HDFS.
    ResourceManager is the master node
        * http://127.0.0.1:8088/cluster

    NodeManager is the slave node (can be more than one)
        * ApplicataionMaster is the first container allocated by the ResourceManager to run on a NodeManager for an application
    '''

LocalJobRunner is typically used for map reduce development and unit testing.

HDFS is a virtual filesystem, meaning that it appears to a client as if it is one system, but the underlying data is located in multiple different locations.
Blocks are actually distributed.

WORM: Write Once, Read Many. Immutability refers to the inabilty to update data after it is committed to the filesystem

HDFS -> Files -> Block (default to 128M)
