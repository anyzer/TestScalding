Scala is an advanced scalable language that restricts imperative features and promotes the development of functional and parallelized code blocks. 
    Scala keeps the object-oriented model and provides functional capabilities and other cool features.
   
Scala modernizes Java's object-oriented approach while adding in the mix functional programming. 
    It compiles into byte-code, and it can be executed on any Java virtual machine; thus, libraries and classes of Java and Scala communicate seamlessly.
